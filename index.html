            <h2>An Example for highly critical patient transport ‚Äì Tagesschau Reports</h2>
            <p>Tagesschau reports: One third of all newborns in Germany are delivered in hospitals offering only the lowest level of care (Level IV) ‚Äì the lowest standard globally according to the WHO. Investigations by the ARD research network reveal that even these minimally equipped clinics admit high-risk pregnancies ‚Äì contrary to guidelines.</p>
            <p class="source">
                Source: <a href="https://www.tagesschau.de/investigativ/br-recherche/geburtskliniken-risikoschwangerschaften-100.html" target="_blank">Tagesschau Report (April 2025)</a>
            </p>
            <h3>Why this matters</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Many of these infants must be transported immediately after birth</li>
                <li>Transport vibrations can trigger brain hemorrhages and long-term damage</li>
                <li>Lack of specialized low-vibration solutions for safe transfers</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Our Answer: Muniqo Performante</h3>
            <p>
                Our technology enables vibration-free transport for newborns ‚Äì serving as a vital link between the birth site and specialized care units. This reduces medical risk and helps avoid costly complications.

                When talking with Prof. Dr. Dr. Neysan Rafat, one of Germany‚Äôs leading neonatologists and responsible for over 350 neonatal transports per year, he emphasized the urgent need for a highly performant, retrofittable system like ours. His words reinforce what we experience in the field: the time for innovation in neonatal transport is now.

            <p>
                Doing what science has long called for: In collaboration with MedCareVisions, the Fire Department Munich, the German Heart Center and TUM, we conducted a realistic simulation of a neonatal transport including patient handover, incubator transfer, ambulance loading and a route across Munich's city center. The Fire Department used a full-size transport incubator and a premature-infant dummy provided by MedCareVisions. At the hospital, trained emergency personnel carried out transfers over stairs, thresholds and ramps just like in a real-life emergency.

            <p>
                This pilot project enabled one of the first continuous real-world vibration recordings during a complete neonatal transport. We observed significant dynamic forces across all axes with a dominant peak in the critical vertical Z-direction, known to be especially harmful to preterm infants.

                Our data support previous scientific findings, but also reveal that force levels in specific situations can exceed established thresholds by a high factor particularly during loading, sudden speed changes, and rough terrain.

            <p>
                The simulated route included typical but vibration-sensitive environments: ambulance loading zones, cobblestone streets, fast road segments, and uneven surfaces such as construction areas or degraded asphalt.

    <h2>Medical Evidence</h2>
    <p class="evidence-intro">
        Several studies and guidelines report an association between neonatal transport and increased rates of complications and mortality. In adult emergency care, while high-quality data remain limited, mechanical stress is increasingly seen‚Äîbased on physiological considerations and expert opinion‚Äîas a relevant factor affecting patient comfort, pain levels, and overall treatment stability.

            <p>
                Most observational studies have shown that preterm infants who were transported postnatally had a higher incidence of severe brain hemorrhages (grades 2‚Äì4).
                This underscores the potential role of transport as a critical risk factor during the first days of life ‚Äì particularly for unstable and immature neonates.

            <p>
                Regardless of the mode of transport (ground or air), neonatal transport exposes infants to high levels of noise, vibration, and acceleration.
                Helicopter or fixed-wing aircraft transports offer the advantage of reducing the time needed for a specialized team to arrive and the overall transport duration,
                but may also involve increased noise and acceleration stress.
                In addition, a drop in cabin pressure can worsen respiratory status; a small observational study showed reduced cerebral oxygenation in some neonates.

                Various mattresses have been tested for incubator transport, with gel mattresses transmitting the least vibration.
                However, due to limited literature, no definitive recommendation can be made.
                Gel mattresses may also pose a higher risk of injury in the event of an accident due to their weight.

                <p>
                    While multiple studies have shown that neonatal transport is associated with increased risks of complications and mortality,
                    the direct causal link between mechanical stress (e.g. vibrations, acceleration, noise) and clinical outcomes remains insufficiently understood.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Still, evidence suggests that acute stress‚Äîtriggered, for example, by unstable positioning‚Äîcan worsen the course of vulnerable conditions,
                    especially in unstable patients. Reports from emergency personnel and physicians reinforce this assessment.
                </p>
                <p>

                        Luca and Sebastian, friends since elementary school, are both trained engineers at the Technical University of Munich with complementary backgrounds. Sebastian, a mechanical and automotive engineer, developed the core idea for Muniqo‚Äôs technology driven by his passion for engineering solutions and shaped by his experience at BMW, where he worked on patented magnetic systems. Luca studied Electrical and Biomedical Engineering, spending several semesters studying Human Medicine. During his translational MedTech research on highly innovative acoustofluidic cell function analysis at TranslaTUM, he co-led a team of talented students with Prof. Hayden during the Go-Bio Spin-Off funding period. Together, they built their first proof of concept in 2023, combining Sebi‚Äôs vision and mechanical design with Luca‚Äôs system architecture and control logic. The project won 3rd place at the renowned TUM IdeAward, earning ‚Ç¨10,000 and confirming the strong potential of their solution.

                        In early 2024, while still completing their studies, Luca and Sebastian applied for the XPLORE program to evaluate the full potential of their technology. After being accepted, they expanded the team with project students from TUM School of Management. Together, they analyzed various application fields for a universal vibration compensation system. Through XPLORE, they gained valuable business insights, conducted early market research, and identified neonatal transport as the most urgent and structured entry market. The technology‚Äôs flexibility became clear across multiple sectors. During this phase, they also collected over 10 Letters of Intent from clinical and industrial stakeholders, confirming the broad interest in their solution. A realistic pilot project was launched in cooperation with the Munich Fire Department, the Herzzentrum, and neonatology experts ‚Äì enabling real-world vibration measurements during neonatal transport. These insights laid the groundwork for the technical and clinical development roadmap. Shortly after, their EXIST funding application was approved, setting the stage for full-time development.

                        After concluding their studies, Luca and Sebastian fully committed to Muniqo in January with the start of EXIST funding, which now supports both operational costs and materials. With full-time focus, development accelerated significantly. In March, Muniqo was accepted into the ESA BIC program ‚Äì based on the broad technological applicability, including future use cases such as vibration-compensated sensor stabilization on satellites to improve resolution.

                        In parallel, the team grew: over 10 academic projects ‚Äì including theses and group projects ‚Äì have already been completed in collaboration with TUM, leading to the recruitment of the first permanent team member beyond the founders: business lead Marie Hesel. Collaborations with TUM Venture Labs and Fraunhofer enabled advanced prototyping and iterative development, including early-stage production capabilities in Garching and multiple system refinements.

                        The pilot project launched in 2024 now enters its second phase in close collaboration with the Munich Fire Department and neonatology teams. Product integration and field tests are scheduled for late 2025. In January, the team won first place at the Munich Impact Incubator. In June, they were finalists at TUM Pitch Perfect, and they are now finalists at Generation D.
